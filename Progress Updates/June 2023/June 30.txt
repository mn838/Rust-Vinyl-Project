Realized I needed a keyboard to type in my password.
Successful in getting one.

Fixed font size of CLI text.
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
    UTF-8, Guess Optimal Character set, Terminus, 16x32

Had wrong keyboard input mode, was UK, changes to US
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
        en_GB.UTF-8 -> en_US.UTF-8
        reboot
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
        USA PC101
        reboot
