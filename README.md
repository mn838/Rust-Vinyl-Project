# Rust-Vinyl-Project

This project involves creating a Raspberry Pi-based device capable of listening to a vinyl player through a microphone, identifying the currently playing song, and displaying the album cover and lyrics on a connected display. The system uses Rust for audio capture, song recognition, fetching album art and lyrics, and creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
